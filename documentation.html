<h2>Design Process:</h2>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For designing my visualization I need to find a data set that interested <br>me. I found a data set of movie ratings based on
    IMDB's ratings. Looking at<br> the data set I wanted to show the top rated movies in the data set. Creating a <br> bar chart was my
    idea moving forward. Designing the visualization I needed <br> to gather the top 10 rated movies and display them on a bar chart.<br><br><br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The initial design process, I wanted to show the movie details when a <br> user hovered over the bar column. I wanted users to be
    able to access the <br> information of each movie in the bar chart. I wanted to display the Title, Rating,<br> Genre and Release Year.
    I came up with a design when they hovered <br>over they would see the information to the right of it. I played around with the<br> visualization
    on my HTML page and ran into some problems. The big problem <br>I as running into was that the information was not displaying like I wanted it.
    I <br>could not get anything other than the title to display, once I added more <br>elements such as the release year nothing would display once hovering
    over a <br>bar column. This problem meant I needed to figure out how to fix the bugs or <br>come up with a different solution. After hours on hours fiddling
    around with the <br>code, I finally started looking for alternatives. After searching around for possible <br>solutions I decided to go with making a
    D3 tooltip function. Creating a tooltip <br>allowed me to display information and messages when a user hovered over a<br> column.
    I used this tooltip found on D3's website as reference when building mine.<br> It allowed me to add however many attribute from the data set as I wanted.
    After <br>further investigation on how many attributes to include I came to the conclusion to <br>only have the original plan as stated before. I went ahead
    and added the title, <br>rating, release year, and genre of each movie.

    <br><br><br>Below picture is the initial design of my visualization:<br><br>

    <h2>Rationale:</h2>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the rationale behind the visualization, I decide to keep all the colors of the <br>charts the same color. I went with a blue color.
    The reason I kept all the bars the <br>same color was so I didn't have to have colors coordinated for each movie. This <br>eliminated the need for a legend
    and having various colors clash for possible<br> colorblind users. Instead I opted into having each bar labeled by the title of the <br>movie.
    This allowed users to see which bar was which instead of having to match <br>color together. I decided to arrange the chart from the highest rating to
    the lowest <br>rating. This also could help users see which is higher a lot quicker than if the bars<br> were randomly put on the axis. Now users could see
    that the far left is the higher<br> rated movies while the further right you go on the chart the ratings starts to decrease.<br> When a user hovers over a
    column it will change to a darker blue so it indicates<br> which bar they are looking at. I decided to have the tooltip display at the top with<br> a black
    and white box so it can be easily read.<br><br>

    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With my visualization I wanted to answer mainly, "What movies were at the top <br> when considering the IMDB ratings?".
    Creating a bar chart would easily be able to <br> answer the main question that I had. One thing that I also incorporated so I could<br> answer
    other questions was the tooltip. Questions like, "What year were the top <br>movies made in?", can be answered using the visualization.
    For example the latest <br>movie to break the top 10 in ratings was in 2010 with Inception as seen below.<br>
